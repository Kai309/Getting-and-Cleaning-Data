# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
## CodeBook.md describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analysis described in this 5 steps:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>

tidydata.txt is the output of the final step
